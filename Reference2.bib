	abstract = {Many social scientists use linear fixed effects regression models for causal inference with longitudinal data to account for unobserved time-invariant confounders. We show that these models require two additional causal assumptions, which are not necessary under an alternative selection-onobservables approach. Specifically, the models assume that past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not directly affect current treatment. The assumed absence of causal relationships between past outcomes and current treatment may also invalidate some applications of before-and-after and difference-in-differences designs. Furthermore, we propose a new matching framework to further understand and improve one-way and two-way fixed effects regression estimators by relaxing the linearity assumption. Our analysis highlights a key trade-off {\textemdash} the ability of fixed effects regression models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and outcome.},

Experimental methods offer the opportunity to significantly improve the evidence for the causal relationships in international business research in a variety of ways. In this article we highlight the value and limitations of experiments in IB research, and explain the basic tenets of experimental design and thinking with the goal of encouraging the submission of more papers with an experimental design to JIBS.},
